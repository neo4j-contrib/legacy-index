1.1 (2010-07-29)
----------------

o Added more methods to remove indexing from an IndexService:
  removeIndex(Node node, String key) and removeIndex(String key).
o Bugfixes regarding closing of underlying Lucene index readers.
o Bugfixes regarding null values.
o Bugfixes regarding recovery.
o Index lookups can be done without being in a transaction.
o Added method for doing exact lookups (even when using a fulltext service).
o Bugfixes regarding doing batch insertion into an existing index.
o Removed isolation levels, the implementation wasn't good enough and the
  different levels wasn't really usable.
o Performance optimizations regarding index lookups when inside a transaction.
o Indexing of array values. If a value is an array it's split up and each value
  in that array is indexed separately.

1.0 (2010-02-16)
----------------

o Bugfixes regarding closing of underlying Lucene indices.
o Fixed a recursion bug in IndexHits.
o LuceneIndexBatchInserterImpl does optimize before shutdown.
o More work on javadoc.

1.0-b1 (2010-01-11)
------------------

o Renamed component from index-util to index.
o Updated to depend on kernel and commons components.
o Updated for new naming scheme.

0.9 (2009-12-27)
----------------

o Better and more complete javadoc.
o Updated lucene version to 2.9.1 and LuceneIndexService (and derivatives)
  as well as LuceneIndexBatchInserter take advantage of some new features.
o Slight performance improvement in LuceneIndexService.getNodes where the
  neo.getNodeById lookups are done lazily in the iterator instead of in
  the getNodes method itself.
o A LuceneIndexBatchInserter can now be exposed as a LuceneIndexService
  via a wrapping class. This is made possible since a BatchInserter can be
  exposed as a NeoService.
o Fixed some bugs and performance issues in LuceneIndexBatchInserterImpl.
  It's now optimized for (as big as possible) blocks of either only reads
  or only writes.
o Fixed so that a LuceneIndexService won't return duplicate entries.
  Duplicate entries can be committed sometimes.
o Deprecated old index implementation.
o Fixed bug that during recovery could read wrong string value from logical 
  log.

0.8 (2009-11-02)
----------------

o Added read only lucene index service.
o Improved LuceneFulltextIndexService query syntax.
o Added batch inserter for lucene fulltext indexer.
o Improved lucene index performance by use of IndexReader#reopen

0.6 (2009-05-03)
----------------
o Upgraded to lucene 2.4.0 making use of the
  IndexWriter.deleteDocument( Query ) method.
o Fixed caching invalidation bug for Lucene index service.
o Fixed deadlock problem when hammering requests on lucene index with
  different transactions.
o Fixed some recovery issues with Lucene index service.
o Patched Lucene index service to have new log rotation features (on line backup).
o Fixed so IndexService.shutdown can handle multiple calls.

0.9 (2009-12-27)
----------------

o Better and more complete javadoc.
o Updated lucene version to 2.9.1 and LuceneIndexService (and derivatives)
  as well as LuceneIndexBatchInserter take advantage of some new features.
o Slight performance improvement in LuceneIndexService.getNodes where the
  neo.getNodeById lookups are done lazily in the iterator instead of in
  the getNodes method itself.
o A LuceneIndexBatchInserter can now be exposed as a LuceneIndexService
  via a wrapping class. This is made possible since a BatchInserter can be
  exposed as a NeoService.
o Fixed some bugs and performance issues in LuceneIndexBatchInserterImpl.
  It's now optimized for (as big as possible) blocks of either only reads
  or only writes.
o Fixed so that a LuceneIndexService won't return duplicate entries.
  Duplicate entries can be committed sometimes.
o Deprecated old index implementation.
o Fixed bug that during recovery could read wrong string value from logical 
  log.

0.8 (2009-11-02)
----------------

o Added read only lucene index service.
o Improved LuceneFulltextIndexService query syntax.
o Added batch inserter for lucene fulltext indexer.
o Improved lucene index performance by use of IndexReader#reopen

0.6 (2009-05-03)
----------------
o Upgraded to lucene 2.4.0 making use of the
  IndexWriter.deleteDocument( Query ) method.
o Fixed caching invalidation bug for Lucene index service.
o Fixed deadlock problem when hammering requests on lucene index with
  different transactions.
o Fixed some recovery issues with Lucene index service.
o Patched Lucene index service to have new log rotation features (on line backup).
o Fixed so IndexService.shutdown can handle multiple calls.
